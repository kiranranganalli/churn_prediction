# Introduction
Customer churn is a significant challenge for e-commerce businesses. This project aims to **predict customer churn** using various machine learning techniques and derive actionable insights to reduce churn rates.

---

# Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of various customer-related features, including:
- **Demographics**: Gender, Marital Status, City Tier
- **Behavioral Metrics**: Number of orders, Complaints, Satisfaction Score
- **Financial Metrics**: Cashback Amount, Coupon Usage, Order Amount Hike from Last Year

**Target Variable:** `Churn` (1 = Churned, 0 = Retained)

---

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
## Churn Distribution
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93622fb5-de3b-4396-8bec-376f557736b7)

- Customers who raised complaints tend to churn more.
- Addressing customer complaints effectively can help reduce churn.

- The dataset is **imbalanced**, with fewer churned customers than retained ones.
- We used **SMOTE** to balance the classes before training the models.

## Feature Correlation Heatmap

- Males have a slightly higher churn rate than females.
- Understanding gender-based behavior can help tailor retention strategies.

- **Tenure and Cashback Amount** show a strong relationship with churn.
- Some categorical variables are converted using **Label Encoding**.

- Customers with lower tenure are more likely to churn.
- Long-term customers have a significantly lower churn rate.

- Churned customers tend to have a lower satisfaction score.
- Higher satisfaction scores are associated with customer retention.

- Customers who churn tend to receive lower cashback amounts.
- Higher cashback incentives are associated with lower churn rates.

## Categorical Feature Analysis
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8922ef26-181f-45c9-998e-7435964623d4)

- Customers from **City Tier 1** have the highest retention rates.
- **City Tier 2 customers** have the highest churn rate.

- **Single customers** have a higher churn rate compared to married and divorced customers.
- Retention strategies can be tailored based on marital status insights.

- Customers who prefer using a **mobile phone** to log in churn more frequently.
- Desktop users have a higher retention rate.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2743a58-f17f-446c-bfd2-ed1280615d23)

- Customers who use **credit cards and debit cards** have the highest retention rates.
- Those relying on **cash on delivery and e-wallets** are more likely to churn.

## Behavioral Insights
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6e8a4b3-cab7-4792-b55d-b463943cb883)

- Customers who churn tend to spend less time on the app.
- Higher app engagement is correlated with lower churn rates.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1da8ee2c-24e0-489a-852d-9a0d812b3206)

- Customers who haven't ordered recently are more likely to churn.
- Encouraging frequent purchases can help retain customers.

# Data Preprocessing
## Key Steps:
- **Handling Missing Values**: Imputation using **median** for numerical columns.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Using **Label Encoding**.
- **Scaling**: Applied **StandardScaler** for numerical features.
- **Class Balancing**: Used **SMOTE** to address class imbalance.

- **Tenure** is the most significant predictor of churn.
- **Cashback Amount and Days Since Last Order** also strongly impact retention.
- **Complaints and Order Count** contribute to churn prediction.

---

# SHAP Interpretability
## SHAP Summary Plot

- SHAP values help explain how each feature contributes to the modelâ€™s predictions.
- Higher **Tenure** and **Cashback Amount** reduce churn likelihood.

---

# Conclusion
- **Longer Tenure and Higher Cashback Amount** significantly reduce churn.
- **Customers with high Order Amount Hike tend to churn** more.
- The **Decision Tree Model** with hyperparameter tuning provides a **strong predictive capability**.
- **SHAP Analysis** enhances interpretability, making the model insights actionable.

## Next Steps
- Deploy the model as a **web API**.
- Further **optimize hyperparameters** using **RandomizedSearchCV**.
- Explore **deep learning models** for more advanced predictions.
